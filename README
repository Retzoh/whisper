Welcome to the Whisper project !

The goal is to provide a small library to experiment rumor source inference algorithms. Some heuristics for the translation of real world data into graphs will also be available, but you're free to implement your own heuristic according to your real world application context.

Examples

Documentation
An survey of recent work on "rumor source inference" is available here. 

Requirements
Python 3.4 or higher
