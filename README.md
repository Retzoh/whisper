# Welcome to the Whisper project !

The goal is to provide a small library to experiment rumor source inference algorithms. Some heuristics for the translation of real world data into graphs will also be available, but you'll be free to implement your own heuristic according to your real world application context.

## Examples
Coming soon...

## Documentation
An survey of recent work on "rumor source inference" is available here. Short version on the wiki, complete one in doc/resume.pdf.

## Requirements
Python 3.4 or higher
Networkx 1.9.1
